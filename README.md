## Key Features

- **LLM-Based Recommendations**  
  Generates personalized scouting insights using DeepSeek's instruction-tuned LLM via OpenAI-compatible API.

- **Dual FAISS Vector Search**  
  Two semantic vector databases (400+ players each for Draft & Midseason) allow real-time filtering by archetype, draft year, position, and more.

- **Interactive Streamlit Dashboard**  
  Clean UI to input queries, display best-fit recommendations, and visualize player stats side-by-side with embedded Tableau dashboards.

- **Smart Filtering**  
  Supports filters like "Top 5 Draft Picks", "3&D Wings", "2025 Bigs with Playmaking", etc., making the tool recruiter-friendly and precise.

## How It Works

1. **Embeddings Generation**  
   - Player bios, stats, and scouting summaries are embedded using `sentence-transformers`.
   - Stored in two separate FAISS indexes (Draft, Midseason).

2. **Query Input & Retrieval**  
   - User inputs a natural language scouting query.
   - Alera uses LangChain to semantically search the relevant FAISS index.

3. **LLM Recommendation**  
   - DeepSeek LLM processes the top retrieved candidates and generates a ranked list with pros/cons and fit explanations.

4. **Visualization**  
   - Recommendations + player Tableau dashboards are rendered via Streamlit for a complete scouting experience.
